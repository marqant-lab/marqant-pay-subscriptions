# Marqant Pay Subscriptions

This package is an extension of the [marqant-lab/marqant-pay](https://github.com/marqant-lab/marqant-pay) package and
 provides subscription functionality for it.

## Installation

To install this package you just need to run the good old composer command that you all know and love.

```shell script
composer require marqant-lab/marqant-pay-subscriptions 
```

Next you will need to create the migrations to hook this package up to your database. Make sure to replace the `User` 
 model with whatever you use as billable. The rest of the values will be taken from the configuration of this package.
 You can overwrite them if you want to.

```shell script
php artisan marqant-pay:migrations:subscriptions App\\User
# or
php artisan marqant-pay:migrations:subscriptions "App\\User"
```

Now you can run your migrations as usual to finish up the installation.

```shell script
php artisan migrate
```

And that's it, you have extended your project with subscriptions ðŸ¤¯

## Usage

In larger applications for your clients, it will be very likely, that they want custom invoices and maybe custom
 billing cycles. But don't worry, marqant-pay got your back! This package enables you to add custom invoice PDF
  templates and
  custom Billing Cycles.
  
### Custom Invoice PDF

To overwrite the default template (which is really just a placeholder) you have to create your own PDF template as a
 blade file under `resources/views/vendor/marqant-pay-subscriptions/pdf/invoice.bade.php`.

### Custom Billing Cylces

If you need to add abilling cycle to your application, then you just need to add it to the configuration and crate a
 handler class for it.
 
```
    /*
     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     | Billing Cycles
     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     |
     | If you are using a custom subscription handler you have to manage your
     | the billing cycles of your app on your own. Each billing cycle has it's
     | own handler class which will be called through the subscription handler.
     | To add new billing cycles you just have to add your own handler in here.
     |

        'monthly' => \Marqant\MarqantPaySubscriptions\BillingCycles\Monthly::class,
